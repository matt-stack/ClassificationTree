# Classification Tree Interactive

[Description]

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
Unity 2018.3.0f2
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Bugs

* The birds can sometimes jump out of the tree structure, either by pushing a button too fast or by the physics of unity when they spawn.
* Game very rarely does not recongize a finished game (right or wrong), unsure why this is
* Not so much as bug just bad design but the game text on the intro level is hard to spot withput knowing its there

## Future plans
* If we kept working, we would want to revamp the UI, make it more friendly and attention-grabbing. Also we would have liked to implement a better 'big data' feature to show how important classification trees can be for big data. We would turn the current big data button (which just increase the bird count to 30, and while it is fun it doesnt work well with the level size) into its own level that can manage a few hundred birds aka representation of data.
