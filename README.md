# Classification Tree Interactive

This interactive is desgined to teach students about some basic concepts of classification trees. The player will have to identify and choose features of a group birds in order to classify them as either common or endangered. After the playing the interactive, the player will be able to:
* Identify a feature given raw data.
* Use a feature to separate data. 
* Assess which features closely fit data into target categories.
* Distinguish between a good feature and a bad feature.

## Bugs

* The birds can sometimes jump out of the tree structure, either by pushing a button too fast or by the physics of unity when they spawn.
* Game does not always recongize a finished game (right or wrong).
* Not so much as bug just bad design but the game text on the intro level is hard to spot withput knowing its there

## Future plans
* If we kept working, we would want to revamp the UI, make it more friendly and attention-grabbing. Also we would have liked to implement a better 'big data' feature to show how important classification trees can be for big data. We would turn the current big data button (which just increase the bird count to 30, and while it is fun it doesnt work well with the level size) into its own level that can manage a few hundred birds aka representation of data.
